## Installation  
The source code of the project is written in **Python 3.7**.  
Different versions of Python may eventually do just fine, but this cannot be guaranteed.   
It is kindly suggested that you setup a python virtual environment in order to properly isolate and install the required dependencies. To this aim, we suggest using **Anaconda**. 

### Anaconda Environment

```
$ conda create --name <your-env-name> python=3.7
$ conda activate <your-env-name>
(<your-env-name>) $ pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
